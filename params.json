{"tagline":"An elevator pitch about me","body":"### Hello there!\r\n\r\n(This page is a work in progress)\r\n\r\nMy name is Ricardo Vitorino and I'm from Coimbra, Portugal. I am currently working at [_Instituto Pedro Nunes - Laboratório de Informática e Sistemas_](http://lis.ipn.pt) as a _software developer_, or better yet, as a _DevOP_ (someone who writes code and works with systems).\r\n\r\nI started working at *IPNLis* after taking my Computer Science Masters Degree at the [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/dei), and I've developed a [mobile application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.metromondego) for local public transportation and been collaborating in a [web platform](https://www.ost.pt) with an amazing team.\r\n\r\nYou can get to know me better by following my [blog](http://blog.ricardovitorino.com) or my [twitter account](http://twitter.com/rjvitorino). Since I write there mainly in Portuguese, feel free to reach me by mail at [me@ricardovitorino.com](mailto:me@ricardovitorino.com).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
